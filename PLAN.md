# Personal Tool / Zink — Development Plan

## 1. Authority

`PLAN.md` is the durable source of truth for milestone/task lifecycle state,
approval, execution authorization, the current execution-contract pointer,
blockers, and completion evidence.

When execution is authorized, `docs/contracts/execution/ACTIVE.md` is the sole
source of truth for that task's frozen implementation details. Architecture is
canonical under `docs/architecture/`; repository-wide agent/safety rules remain
in `AGENTS.md`.

Planning never authorizes implementation by itself.

## 2. Status model

```text
Task Status: NOT STARTED | IN PROGRESS | BLOCKED | COMPLETE | DEFERRED | CANCELLED
Planning Readiness: DRAFT | REVIEWED | APPROVED
Execution Authorization: NO | YES
Execution Contract: NONE | docs/contracts/execution/ACTIVE.md
Evidence Level: NONE | LOCAL-VERIFIED | REMOTE-BACKED
```

## 3. Current release gate

| Milestone | Status | Evidence | Gate summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0 — Plan/architecture baseline | `COMPLETE` | `LOCAL-VERIFIED` | Repository governance established. |
| M1 — Development foundation | `COMPLETE` | `REMOTE-BACKED` | Verification and CI/Security baseline passed. |
| M2 — Local infrastructure | `COMPLETE` | `REMOTE-BACKED` | Accepted commit `5ffe4cb9be81c30d5c24bd7eb6a9d41abc2a5f19`. |
| M3 — Markdown Knowledgebase | `COMPLETE` | `REMOTE-BACKED` | Accepted candidate `ff4a5fb7d779f260ffb9b5aa2393ad6ab75eb549`; accepted merge `9cd34cebb196631e9524b095c21f1fd5aff78749`. |
| M4 — PDF ingestion | `COMPLETE` | `REMOTE-BACKED` | T1–T5 pushed; owner has temporarily accepted M4 as complete. Exact accepted commit hash should be reconciled from git history without reopening M4 scope. |
| M5 — Architecture contraction | `COMPLETE` | `REMOTE-BACKED` | M5/T1-R2 synchronized canonical paths, documentation and the contracted Docker runtime without refactoring the accepted Knowledgebase application. |
| M6 — Zink Skill Store | `COMPLETE` | `REMOTE-BACKED` | M6/T1-R4 task commit is remotely verified; governance closeout is recorded separately. |
| M7 — Zink Tools + OpenClaw integration + V1 hardening | `IN PROGRESS` | `NONE` | M7/T1-R16 Discord permission-gate correction is owner-approved and authorized. |

The former self-built L&SC Data Plant is replaced by a **logical external
infrastructure flow**, not another repository module. Forecasting, optimization,
operations research and simulation remain first-class capabilities.

## 4. Current focus

```text
Milestone: M7 — Zink Tools + OpenClaw Integration + V1 Hardening
Task: M7/T1 — OpenClaw foundation
Task Status: IN PROGRESS
Planning Readiness: APPROVED
Plan Revision: M7/T1-R16
Execution Authorization: YES
Authorized Task: M7/T1 — OpenClaw foundation
Execution Contract: docs/contracts/execution/ACTIVE.md
Evidence Level: NONE
Task Branch: codex/m7-t1-openclaw-foundation
Owner Approval: 2026-09-07 explicit permission-gate correction and commit instruction
```

M6/T1-R4 evidence: focused M6 tests, `npm run verify` (64 tests),
`git diff --check`, staged diff check, and scope review passed. Task commit
`fb746021b8b1a51080d1ba4fed4b35011bb78ce6` is remotely verified on
`origin/codex/m6-t1-git-native-skill-store`. Post-completion fix commit
`652ed9bd248dcc047a2be09300aaaba1d9c2dbbf` is also remotely verified there.

Host operation: `.wslconfig` was backed up without overwrite, changed only from
`memory=9728MB` to `memory=8192MB`, and read back successfully. No
`wsl --shutdown` was run; effective application remains owner-controlled through
a later WSL restart.

M4/T5 is treated as **temporarily accepted and complete by the owner** after the
Codex push. The exact accepted commit hash is intentionally not invented here; it
should be reconciled from git history/remote evidence by Codex or the owner when
convenient. Do not reopen M4 implementation scope merely to fill that metadata.

M4/T1 through M4/T4 are complete locally:

| Task | Status | Evidence summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M4/T1 — Runtime, source, schema, identity | `COMPLETE` | Feature commit `c4ef66d`; isolated PDF runtime and M3 regression gates passed. |
| M4/T2 — Preflight, extraction, segmentation | `COMPLETE` | Implementation commit `82126e4`; bounded extraction/OCR and atomic non-searchable builds passed. |
| M4/T3 — Resume, drift, retention, publication | `COMPLETE` | Local implementation commit `c1df143`; resumability and atomic publication passed. |
| M4/T4 — Adapters, retrieval, API | `COMPLETE` | Reviewed local implementation commit `1904853`; Markdown/PDF retrieval, filters, citations, and repository gates passed. |
| M4/T5 — Acceptance and handoff | `COMPLETE` | Owner reports the accepted M4/T5 state was pushed and is temporarily closed; exact remote commit evidence remains to be reconciled from git history. |

The owner's 2026-08-28 correction remains authoritative for `M4/T5-R2`:
visible internal PDF embeds drive sidecar recognition; ordinary Books/Papers
Markdown is ignored by PDF discovery; `zink_source: pdf` is not required.

M4/T5 is closed for current planning purposes. Architecture contraction must not
refactor or destabilize the accepted M3/M4 Knowledgebase runtime unless a later,
separately approved migration explicitly authorizes it.

## 5. Canonical target architecture

The repository retains three logical modules.

Canonical new-work paths are:

```text
platforms/knowledge-platform/   # accepted current Knowledgebase runtime
zink-skill-store/               # peer Skill Store module
zink-tools/                     # peer Tools module
integrations/openclaw/          # external OpenClaw integration
```

The current Knowledgebase runtime path is retained for compatibility; it is not
the parent of Zink Skill Store or Zink Tools.

### 5.1 Zink Knowledgebase

- owns approved human/reference knowledge, ingestion, retrieval, provenance and
  citations;
- preserves the existing owner-approved Knowledgebase taxonomy and Supply Chain
  coverage; this plan does not redefine or narrow it;
- may include Decision and Business Semantics knowledge through the existing
  taxonomy when approved;
- keeps the source Obsidian Vault human-owned and read-only;
- preserves accepted M3/M4 runtime paths until a separately approved migration.

### 5.2 Zink Skill Store

- owns reusable governed skills and their lifecycle/provenance;
- owns reusable **Excel and Power BI templates** as owner-authored assets;
- keeps Knowledgebase research state logically isolated from learned skills;
- uses task metadata rather than physically splitting Work and Research stores;
- normal skill retrieval returns governed/published versions only.

Task-mode rule:

```text
mode: work | research
```

Main classifies mode from task intent. For mixed tasks it may assign a primary
and secondary mode. Research outputs are never silently promoted into a work or
production path.

### 5.3 Zink Tools

Zink Tools is the callable execution surface for OpenClaw and approved n8n
workflows:

```text
excel
power-bi
sql
python
n8n
forecast
optimization
operations-research
simulation
```

OpenClaw owns orchestration, specialist routing, sandboxing, permissions, task
mode and model/tool execution policy. n8n owns deterministic triggers, schedules,
connectors and workflow run state. Zink Tools owns neither orchestration nor
persistent Knowledge/Skill state.

## 6. Five-stack model

```text
STACK 5 — DECISION
Main + O1 + O2: compare alternatives, risk/trade-offs, recommendation

STACK 4 — INTELLIGENCE
Forecast / Optimization / Operations Research / Simulation

STACK 3 — SEMANTIC
O1: domain meaning, KPI, business rules, constraints, policies

STACK 2 — EXECUTION
Excel / Power BI / SQL / Python / n8n

STACK 1 — INFRASTRUCTURE
R2 / DuckDB / MotherDuck / Kaggle / Databricks / local compute
```

Stacks are functional layers, not permanent one-agent-per-stack processes.
Baseline execution specialists are Excel, Power BI, SQL and Python. Intelligence
specialists may be created or invoked lazily.

## 7. L&SC Data Plant — logical flow only

The historical name is retained only as an architectural description of how L&SC
data and compute move through existing infrastructure:

```text
Source
→ n8n / Python
→ R2 / DuckDB / MotherDuck
→ Kaggle / Databricks / local compute
→ Forecast / Optimization / OR / Simulation
→ OpenClaw
→ Excel / Power BI delivery when required
```

There is no separate L&SC Data Plant runtime/platform to build.

Explicitly out of scope:

- self-built Bronze/Silver/Gold lakehouse;
- generic ETL control plane;
- feature store or generic model registry;
- generic MLOps/training platform;
- duplicated OpenClaw or n8n workflow/orchestration state;
- direct adapter writes to Knowledgebase/Skill Store persistence internals.

## 8. Delivery sequence

```text
M0 Plan/Architecture
→ M1 Development Foundation
→ M2 Local Infrastructure
→ M3 Markdown Knowledgebase
→ M4 PDF Ingestion                 [COMPLETE]
→ M5 Architecture Contraction      [COMPLETE]
→ M6 Zink Skill Store              [COMPLETE / REMOTE-BACKED]
→ M7 Zink Tools + OpenClaw Integration + V1 Hardening/Release
```

### M5 — Architecture Contraction

Status: `COMPLETE`
Execution Authorization: `NO`

Current scope:

- keep the accepted Knowledgebase runtime under `apps/knowledge/` and
  `platforms/knowledge-platform/` until a separately approved runtime migration;
- make `zink-skill-store/` a peer module rather than a child of Knowledgebase;
- make `zink-tools/` a peer module rather than an integration subsystem;
- use `integrations/openclaw/` as the canonical OpenClaw integration path;
- remove obsolete `integrations/agents-system/`, nested Skill Store paths, legacy
  `integrations/zink-tools/`, and residual L&SC Data Plant runtime scaffolding;
- retain only `docs/architecture/lsc-data-flow.md` for the historical L&SC Data
  Plant concept: a logical external data/compute flow, not a runtime module;
- preserve the existing Knowledgebase taxonomy and Supply Chain coverage;
- formalize the five-stack mapping without creating five new runtime modules;
- do not refactor M3/M4 ingestion code merely for folder symmetry.

### M6 — Zink Skill Store

Status: `COMPLETE`
Task: `M6/T1 — Git-native governed skill core`
Plan Revision: `M6/T1-R4`
Execution Authorization: `NO`
Execution Contract: `NONE`
Evidence: `REMOTE-BACKED`
Task Commit: `fb746021b8b1a51080d1ba4fed4b35011bb78ce6`
Task Branch: `codex/m6-t1-git-native-skill-store`
Upstream: `origin/codex/m6-t1-git-native-skill-store`
Remote Task Verification: `PASS`
Post-completion Fix Commit: `652ed9bd248dcc047a2be09300aaaba1d9c2dbbf`
Remote Fix Verification: `PASS`

M6/T1 delivered Git-managed strict JSON manifests and Markdown content,
complete-catalog fail-closed validation, and exact retrieval of one ACTIVE
version. Routing context remains M7/OpenClaw policy and is not manifest
metadata. M6/T1 completion closes M6 after this governance closeout commit is
remotely verified.

### M7 — Zink Tools + OpenClaw Integration + V1 Hardening

Status: `IN PROGRESS`
Task: `M7/T1 — OpenClaw foundation`
Plan Revision: `M7/T1-R16`
Planning Readiness: `APPROVED`
Execution Authorization: `YES`
Execution Contract: `docs/contracts/execution/ACTIVE.md`
Evidence: `NONE`

M7/T1-R16 retains the R15 minimal-tool compatibility decision and records the
owner's 2026-09-07 correction that Discord capability evidence is an operational
minimum gate, not an exact non-admin permission allowlist. All 28 account/surface
pairs must expose the required text/forum permissions; administrator,
channel/role/webhook management, and application-command permission remain
forbidden. Commands and additive tool grants remain disabled, and model
selection remains constrained to the two Google aliases. Exact implementation
details are frozen in
`docs/contracts/execution/ACTIVE.md`; internal delegation remains disabled until
T2.

Minimum scope:

- four baseline execution specialists: Excel, Power BI, SQL and Python;
- tool surfaces for Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python and n8n;
- decision-science tool surfaces for Forecast, Optimization, OR and Simulation;
- Main intent classification to `work`, `research`, or mixed primary/secondary;
- external infrastructure usage through the lightest practical integration;
- training/heavy compute stays on approved external infrastructure when needed;
- compatibility tests, bounded errors/timeouts and failure isolation;
- no secret values committed to integration configs.

## 9. Deferred beyond V1

Unless separately approved:

- image/video ingestion;
- self-hosted generic data lake/lakehouse;
- self-hosted generic forecasting/ML/OR training platform;
- Kubernetes/Kafka/distributed orchestration;
- speculative microservices, queues, workers or control planes.

## 10. Decision log

| Decision | Current rule |
| --- | --- |
| Repository scope | Three logical modules: Knowledgebase, Skill Store, Tools. |
| Knowledgebase taxonomy | Preserve existing owner-approved taxonomy and Supply Chain coverage. |
| Templates | Excel/Power BI templates are owner-built assets stored in Zink Skill Store. |
| Work/Research | Main infers mode from intent; mode is metadata, not a second store. |
| Execution specialists | Excel, Power BI, SQL and Python are the baseline four. |
| Five Stack | Functional processing layers; agents may serve more than one stack. |
| L&SC Data Plant | Logical external-infrastructure/data-compute flow only; no platform runtime. |
| Model artifacts | Heavy artifacts stay external; repository keeps only lightweight metadata/config/evaluation references when needed. |
| OpenClaw | External runtime/orchestrator and task-mode classifier. |
| n8n | Deterministic workflow/trigger/schedule plumbing. |
