# Changelog

All notable, validated changes to Personal Tool are documented here.

`CHANGELOG.md` records completed work only. It is not a roadmap, task list, development status, or architecture proposal.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Established the local Git repository, private GitHub remote, and documented development conventions for M1/T1.
- Added a pinned Node/npm quality baseline with reproducible formatting, linting, testing, and repository-policy verification for M1/T2.
- Added isolated Git-fixture tests for sensitive-file allowlists, working-tree whitespace, Git whitespace, required files, and command placeholders.
- Added CI and Security workflows with exact Node 24.15.0/npm 12.0.2 provisioning, high/critical dependency audit, full-history Gitleaks scanning, and immutable Action pins for M1/T3.
- Added YAML 1.2 semantic workflow-contract validation with focused unit coverage for executable commands, ordering, permissions, Action pins, and Gitleaks safeguards.

### Changed

- Replaced the Makefile placeholder with functional quality-gate targets backed by npm scripts and a committed lockfile.
- Replaced the initial partial scaffold with the approved Personal Tool architecture.
- Centralized observability under `infrastructure/observability/`.
- Separated document-oriented Knowledge RAG from L&SC Data Product RAG.
- Added cross-platform tests, experimental workspaces, and CI workflow placeholders.
- Replaced the CI, Security, and redundant test-workflow placeholders with the validated `CI / quality-gate`, `Security / dependency-audit`, and `Security / secret-scan` checks.

## Changelog Rules

### Completed Changes Only

An entry may be added only after the corresponding task reaches its Definition of Done in `PLAN.md`.

Do not record:

- planned work;
- work in progress;
- blocked work;
- placeholders;
- empty directories;
- unverified code;
- speculative architecture;
- future milestones.

### Categories

Use the following categories:

- `Added` — new validated functionality.
- `Changed` — validated changes to existing functionality.
- `Fixed` — validated bug fixes.
- `Security` — validated security improvements or fixes.

### Source of Truth

`PLAN.md` is the authoritative source for:

- current progress;
- Active Task;
- milestone status;
- component status;
- dependencies;
- completion evidence.

`CHANGELOG.md` is only the historical record of changes that have already been completed and validated.

Do not use this file to determine what should be implemented next.

### Evidence

Every changelog entry must correspond to verified repository state.

A file, directory, configuration declaration, placeholder, or documentation entry does not by itself prove that functionality is implemented.

Validation evidence is maintained in `PLAN.md`.

### Update Timing

When a task reaches Definition of Done:

1. update `PLAN.md`;
2. record the completion evidence;
3. add the corresponding changelog entry;
4. keep these changes in the same change set whenever practical.

Do not add a changelog entry before validation is complete.

This file records material architectural changes rather than individual commits.
